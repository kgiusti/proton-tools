To build, create a "build" directory at the same level as this README:

  mkdir build
  cd build

If you don't have the proton developer libraries/includes installed,
you'll need to check out a copy of the proton build tree and build the
C libraries (see the proton project for details) .  Once built, set
the path to the top level directory (the directory that contains
'proton-c') via the "PROTON_SOURCE_DIR" build variable:

  cmake -DPROTON_SOURCE_DIR=/home/kgiusti/work/proton/qpid-proton ..

This should result in a server executable (f-server), and a client
executable (f-client).

Run the server:

./f-server -a amqp://~0.0.0.0

And in a different shell, run the client:

./f-client -a amqp://0.0.0.0


## Running with dispatch-router

./f-server -a amqp://0.0.0.0:5672/SERVER
./f-client -a amqp://0.0.0.0:5672/SERVER -r amqp://0.0.0.0:5672/CLIENT
